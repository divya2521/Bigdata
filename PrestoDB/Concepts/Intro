Presto is an open source distributed SQL query engine for running interactive analytic queries against data sources of all
sizes ranging from gigabytes to petabytes. It was developed by Facebook.

Presto was designed and written from the ground up for interactive analytics and approaches the speed of commercial 
data warehouses while scaling to the size of organizations like Facebook.

Presto allows querying data where it lives, including Hive, HBase, relational databases or even proprietary data stores. 
A single Presto query can combine data from multiple sources, allowing for analytics across your entire organization.

Presto is targeted at analysts who expect response times ranging from sub-second to minutes. 
Presto breaks the false choice between having fast analytics using an expensive commercial solution or 
using a slow "free" solution that requires excessive hardware.
