stream operator example:

Download the dataset NYSE_dividends from alangates programming pig data folder:
https://github.com/alanfgates/programmingpig/blob/c77436c2d0416574966a2e9925b4ee4b6eb5caca/data/NYSE_dividends


write a perl program to enable control: "highdiv.pl"

#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;

while (<>) {
	my @fields = split;
	if ($fields[3] > 1.0) {
		print join("\t", @fields) . "\n"
	}
}

change the file permission of perl script:
chmod 755 <path>/highdiv.pl

divs = load '/pig/divs' as (exchange, symbol, date, dividends);
highdivs = stream divs through `/home/naga/bigdata/highdiv.pl` as (exchange, symbol, date, dividends);
dump highdivs;


we can also ship the external program using the following statement:

define highdivs `/home/naga/bigdata/highdiv.pl` ship('/home/naga/bigdata/highdiv.pl');

divs = load '/pig/divs' as (exchange, symbol, date, dividends);
highdivs = stream divs through highdivs as (exchange, symbol, date, dividends);
dump highdivs;
