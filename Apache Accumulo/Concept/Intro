Apache Accumulo is designed based on Google's BigTable design and is built on top of Apache Hadoop, Zookeeper, and Thrift. 
Apache Accumulo features a few novel improvements on the BigTable design in the form of cell-based access control 
and a server-side programming mechanism that can modify key/value pairs at various points in the data management process.
