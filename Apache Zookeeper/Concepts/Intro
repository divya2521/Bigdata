Introduction:
------------
Apache Zookeeper is an open source project from Apache Software Foundation
Apache Zookeepr is distributed coordination service which is used to build general purpose distributed applications.

In distributed systems, partial failures are common. In distibuted systems, many nodes communicate each other, some these 
operations may fail and sender doen't know the staus of the message. To guaranty the communication between nodes, we need 
very realiable coordination service.

ZooKeeper canâ€™t make partial failures go away, these are intrinsic to distributed systems. Zookeeper handles all these
partial failures and it connot hide them.

Features of ZooKeeper:
----------------------
1. ZooKeeper is simple:  A stripped-down filesystem that exposes a few simple operations, and some 
    extra abstractions such as ordering and notifications.
2. ZooKeeper is expressive: Its primitives are a rich set of building blocks that can be used to build
    a large class of coordination data structures and protocols. 
    Examples include: dis-tributed queues, distributed locks, and leader election among a group of peers.
3.  Zookeeper is highly available: It runs on a collection of machines and is designed to be highly available.
    There is no single point of failure and it is reliable
4. ZooKeeper facilitates loosely coupled interactions: Participants that do not need to know about one
    another. Zookeeper can act as communicator in betwwen them, one can leave message in zookeeper and other one
    can read it even first is shutdown also.
5. ZooKeeper is a library: shared repository of implementations and recipes of common coordination patterns. 
    Individual people can write thier own custom protocols and the community can add to and improve the libraries.
