Apache Tez generalizes the MapReduce paradigm to a more powerful framework for executing a complex DAG 
(directed acyclic graph) of tasks. MapReduce has been the data processing backbone for Hadoop, but its batch-oriented 
nature makes it unsuited for interactive query. Tez will allow projects in the Apache Hadoop ecosystem such as Apache Hive 
and Apache Pig to meet demands for fast response times and extreme throughput at petabyte scale.

Apache Tez runs on Hadoop YARN. It doen't work on Hadoop 1.X.X distribution.
