> Scala was created by Martin Ordersky. Scala stands for "Scalable Language"
> It is blend of functional, Object oreinted and powerful type system
> Scala is mix of the following things:
  1.  Blend of functional and object oreinted
  2.  Expressive syntax and static typing
  3.  Advanced Language features and rich Java integration
  
> Scala has the ability to focus on objetcs or functions in a program, depending on what is the most prominent
> Scala has several features which are not there in Java, but scala runs over JVM.

> Object-oriented programming                 Functional programming
  Composition of objects (nouns)              Composition of functions (verbs)
  Encapsulated stateful interaction           Deferred side effects
  Iterative algorithms                        Recursive algorithms and continuations
  Imperative flow                             Lazy evaluation
  N/A                                         Pattern matching

> Object orientation can focus on the nouns of the system and functional programming can compose the verbs
> AnyRef is equivalent of java.lang.Object in Scala
> Scala defines three types of variables val, var, lazy val
